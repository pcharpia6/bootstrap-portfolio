                                I work for a data generation company in RTP specializing in Metabolomics. Specifically I manage the chemistry personnel providing samples to be analyzed. This position supplies a never-ending list of new and exciting challenges every day. I have become quite knowledgable about extraction chemistry, personality management, long-term task completion tracking, and also quite skilled in problem solving.

                                I met my wife on the dating website E-Harmony 5 years ago. It did not take long for us to be married and ready to find a place to settle down. Mebane has wonderful amenities and a small town feel, not to mention the cheapest property taxes in the area, and so we found a small house to buy. We make such a great team that we decided to grow our team, and we took on a beautiful healthy baby boy in December of 2016. His joy and energy make a wonderful end to every day.

                                Now I have decided to take on the mammoth task of learning web development computer engineering. Hopefully the UNC Coding Bootcamp will help that process along!
